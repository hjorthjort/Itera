# Itera

Testing 3 different algorithms for grouping anagrams together. Each algorithm creates a unique 
and identical key for all words which are anagrams of each other.

To see the output (in markdown format) of these algorithms on a complete unix dictionary, with 
some data on performance time, got to [test_results.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hjorthjort/Itera/master/test_results.md).

Just running times can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/hjorthjort/Itera/wiki).
